			<h3 style="text-align:center"><b>A.Pin out Description:</b></h3>
			
			<p>8051 microcontrollers have 4 I/O ports each comprising 8 pins which can be configured as inputs or outputs.</p>
			 <div align="center"><img src="pin_diagram.png"/></div>  
			<p><b>Pins 1 to 8(Port 1)</b>: The Pins 1.0 to 1.7 are 8 Pins of port 1. Each of them can be configured as input or output pin.<br />
			<b><br />
			Pin 9</b>: It is used to Reset Microcontroller 8051. A positive pulse is given on this Pin to reset Microcontroller.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Pin 10 to 17(Port 3)</b>: These Pins are similar to Pins of Port 1. These Pins can be used as universal Input or output. These are dual function Pins. Function of each Pin is given as:</p>

			<p><b>Pin 10</b>: It is Serial synchronous Communication Input or Serial Asynchronous Communication input.</p>

			<p><b>Pin 11: </b>Serial Asynchronous Communication Output or Serial Synchronous Communication Output.</p>

			<p><b>Pin 12</b>: Interrupt 0 input.</p>

			<p><b>Pin 13: </b>Interrupt 1 input.</p>

			<p><b>Pin 14</b>: Counter 0 clock input.</p>

			<p><b>Pin 15: </b>Counter 1 clock input.</p>

			<p><b>Pin 16</b>: Writing Signal for Writing content on external RAM.</p>

			<p><b>Pin 17</b>: Reading Signal to read contents of external RAM.</p>

			<p><b>Pin 18 and 19</b>: These are input output PINS for oscillator. An internal oscillator is connected to Micro controller through these PINS.</p>

			<p><b>Pin 20</b>: Pin 20 is grounded.</p>

			<p><b>Pin 21 to 28 (Port 2)</b>:These Pins can be configured as Input Output Pins. But this is only possible in case when we don't use any external memory. If we use external memory then these pins will work as high order address bus(A8 to A15).</p>

			<p><b>Pin 29</b>: If we uses an external ROM then it should has a logic 0 which indicates Micro controller to read data from memory.</p>

			<p><b>Pin 30</b>: This Pin is used for ALE that is Address Latch Enable. If we uses multiple memory chips then this pin is used to distinguish between them. This Pin also gives program pulse input during programming of EPROM.</p>

			<p><b>Pin 31</b>: If we have to use multiple memories then by applying logic 1 to this pin instructs Micro controller to read data from both memories first internal and afterwards external.</p>

			<p><b>Pin 32 to 39(Port 0)</b>: Similar to port 2 and 3, these pins can be used as input output pins when we don't use any external memory. When ALE or Pin 30 is at 1 then this port is used as data bus, when ALE pin at 0, then this port is used as lower order address bus(A0 to A7).</p>
		</div>

		<div id="abcpu_registers">
			<h3 style="text-align:center">B. A and B CPU Registers:</h3>

			<p>Registers A and B, comprise the mathematical core of the 8051 central processing unit(CPU).</p>

			<p>The A (accumulator) register is the most versatile of the two CPU registers and is used for many operations, including addition, subtraction, integer multiplication and division and Boolean bit manipulations. The register B is also used with the A register for multiplication and division operations.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="pc_dptr">
			<h3 style="text-align:center">C. Program Counter and Data Pointer </h3>

			<p>The 8051 contains two 16-bit registers: the program counter (PC) and the data pointer (DPTR). Each is used to hold the address of a byte in memory. </p>

			<p>Program instruction bytes are fetched from locations in memory that are addressed by the PC. Program ROM may be on the chip at addresses 0000h to 0FFFh, external to the chip for addresses that exceed 0FFFh, or totally external for all addresses from 0000h to FFFFh. The PC is automatically incremented after every instruction byte is fetched and may also be altered by certain instructions. The PC is the only register that does not have an internal address. </p>

			<p>The DPTR register is made up of two 8-bit registers named DPH and DPL, that are used to furnish memory addresses for internal and external code access and external data access. The DPTR is under the control of program instructions and can be specified by its 16-bit name, DPTR, or by each individual byte name, DPH and DPL. DPTR does not have a single internal address; DPH and DPL are each assigned an address.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="flag_psw">
			<h3 style="text-align:center">D. Flags and the Program Status Word (PSW) </h3>

			<p>Flags are 1-bit registers provided to store the results of certain program instructions. Other instructions can test the condition of the flags and make decisions based upon the flag states. In order that the flags may be conveniently addressed, they are grouped inside the program status word (PSW) and the power control (PCON) registers. </p>
			<div align="center"><img src="psw.png"/></div>
		</div>

		<div id="sfrs">
			<h3 style= "text-align:center">E. Special Function Registers</h3>

			<p>The 8051 operations that do not use the internal 128-byte RAM addresses from 00h to 7Fh are done by a group of specific internal registers, each called a special-function register (SFR), which may be addressed much like internal RAM using addresses from 80h to FFh .</p>

			<p>Some SFRs are also bit addressable, as is the case for the bit area of RAM. This feature allows the programmer to change only what needs to be altered, leaving the remaining bits in that SFR unchanged.</p>

			<p>The SFR names and equivalent internal RAM addresses are given in the following list:</p>

			<h3 style= "text-align:center">F. The Stack and the Stack Pointer</h3>

			<p>The stack refers to an area of internal RAM that is used in conjunction with certain opcode to store and retrieve data quickly. The 8-bit stack pointer (SP) register is used by the 8051 to hold an internal RAM address that is called the "top of the stack." The address held in the SP register is the location in internal RAM where the last byte of data was stored by a stack operation.</p>

			<p>The data storing and retrieving from stack and corresponding contents of stack pointer are shown in fig. </p>

			<p>The 128-byte internal RAM, which is generally organized into three distinct areas:</p>

			<p>1. Thirty-two bytes from address 00h to 1Fh that make up 32 working registers or­ganized as four banks of eight registers each. The four register banks are num­bered 0 to 3 and are made up of eight registers named R0 to R 7.</p>

			<p>2. A bit-addressable area of 16 bytes occupies RAM byte addresses 20h to 2Fh, forming a total of 128 addressable bits. </p>

			<p>3. A general-purpose RAM area above the bit area, from 30h to 7Fh, addressable as bytes.</p>

		<div id="osc_clock">
			<h3 style="test-align:center">H. The 8051 Oscillator and Clock </h3>

			<p>The heart of the 8051 is the circuitry that generates the clock pulses by which all internal operations are synchronized. Pins XTALI and XTAL2 are provided for connecting a resonant network to form an oscillator. Typically, a quartz crystal and capacitors are employed, as shown in Figure. The crystal frequency is the basic internal clock frequency of the microcontroller</p>

	<p><b>1. Led Bar interfacing </b></p>
	<div align="center"><img src="led_circuit.png"/></div>
	<p>The principle of operation of LEDs is simple. The commonly available LEDs have a drop voltage of 1.7 V and need 10 mA to glow at full intensity. The value of resistance R can be calculated using the equation, R= (V-1.7)/10 mA. Since most of the controllers work on 5V, so substituting V= 5V, the value of resistance comes out to be 330 ohm. The resistance 220 ohm, 470 ohm is commonly used substitute in case 330 ohm is not available.</p>

	<p>LEDs are connected to the port P0. LEDs need approximately 10mA current to flow through them in order to glow at maximum intensity. However the output of the controller is not sufficient enough to drive the LEDs, so if the positive leg of the LED is connected to the pin and the negative to ground as shown in the figure, the LED will not glow at full illumination.</p>

	<p>As soon as we provide supply to the controller, the LEDs start blinking i.e., they become on for a certain time duration and then become off for the same time duration. This delay is provided by calling the delay function. The values inside the delay function have been set to provide a delay in multiples of millisecond (delay (100) will provide a delay of 100 millisecond).</p>

	<div id="seven_segment">
	<p><b>2. Seven segment display interfacing</b></p>

	<p>7 segment LED display is very popular and it can display digits from 0 to 9 and quite a few characters like A, b, C, ., H, E, e, F, n, o, t, u, y, etc. A seven segment display consists of seven LEDs arranged in the form of a square<strong> '8'</strong> slightly inclined to the right and a single LED as the dot character. Different characters can be displayed by selectively glowing the required LED segments. Seven segment displays are of two types, <strong><i>common cathode and common anode.</i></strong> In common cathode type , the cathode of all LEDs are tied together to a single terminal which is usually labeled as '<strong>com</strong>' and the anode of all LEDs are left alone as individual pins labeled as a, b, c, d, e, f, g &amp; h (or dot) .</p>

	<div id="dac">
	<p><b>3. Digital to Analog Converter (DAC) interfacing</b></p>
	<div align="center"><img src="dac.png"/></div>
	<p>The digital-to-analog converter (DAC) is a device widely used to convert digital pulses to analog signals. The first criterion for judging a DAC is its resolution, which is a function of the number of binary inputs. The common ones are 8, 10, and 12 bits. The number of data bit inputs decides the resolution of the DAC since the number of analog output levels is equal to 2, where <em>n </em>is the number of data bit inputs. Therefore, an 8-input DAC such as the DAC0808 provides 256 discrete voltage (or current) levels of output.</p>

	<p>The total current provided by the I<sub>out</sub> pin is a function of the binary numbers at the DO to D7 inputs of the DAC0808 and the reference current (I<sub>re</sub>f), and is as follows:</p>

	<div id= "stepper_motor">
	<p><b>4. Stepper Motor interfacing</b></p>
	<div align="center"><img src="stepper_motor_mc.png"/></div>
	<p>To cause the stepper to rotate, we have to send a pulse to each coil in turn. The 8051 does not have sufficient drive capability on its output to drive each coil, so there are a number of ways to drive a stepper, </p>

	<p>Stepper motors are usually controlled by transistor or driver IC like ULN2003. <br />
	<br />
	Driving current for each coil is then needed about 60mA at +5V supply. A Darlington transistor array, ULN2003 is used to increase driving capacity of the 2051 chip. </p>

	<p>As you can see the stepper motor is connected with Microcontroller output port pins through a ULN2003 array. So when the microcontroller is giving pulses with particular frequency to ULN2003, the motor is rotated in clockwise or anticlockwise. </p>
